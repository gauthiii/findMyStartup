## How to Run

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into the root.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set the environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_api_key
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-endpoint.openai.azure.com
   AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your-deployment-name
   ```
4. Run the server:
   ```bash
   node backend/server.js
   ```
5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3010`

## Notes

- Local/session storage is used to persist model selection and startup idea across screens.
- Validation is in place to prevent screen access without required session state.
- UI is enhanced using Tailwind CSS and modern card-based layouts.
